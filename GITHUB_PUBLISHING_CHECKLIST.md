# Go-LLama GitHub Publishing & Public Deployment Checklist

_Use this document to track the progress of putting Go-LLama on GitHub for public deployment.  
Update with notes, links, and status as you go._

---

## **1. Local Project Preparation**

- [x] All source code present (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `frontend/`, etc.)
- [x] Config files (`config.json`, `config.sample.json`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- [x] Docs (`README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `MANUAL_TESTING.md`, `HARDENING.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `openapi/openapi.yaml`)
- [x] Static assets (`static/Go-Llama-logo.png`, `static/favicon.ico`)
- [x] `.gitignore` created (protect secrets, binaries, logs)
- [x] Remove/clean any secrets before publishing

**Notes:**  
- Used `config.sample.json` with sample values, but included actual LLM/SearxNG endpoints for reference/adaptation.
- Verified no personal info or secrets in the repo.
- Confirmed Docker build context includes `frontend/` and static assets.

---

## **2. Create New GitHub Repository**

- [x] Go to https://github.com and log in
- [x] Click "+" â†’ "New repository"
- [x] Name: `go-llama`
- [x] Set **Public** for open sharing
- [x] Add project description
- [x] Did NOT initialize with README (already have a local one)

**Notes:**  
- Used existing local folder, did NOT clone empty repo.

---

## **3. Add Local Files to Repo**

- [x] Committed: `git commit -m "Initial commit: Go-LLama source code, config, docs, assets"`
- [x] Pushed: `git push -u origin main`
- [x] Resolved branch and email privacy issues (used GitHub no-reply email, force push)
- [x] Dockerfile and config updated for backend, frontend inclusion, and Compose networking

**Notes:**  
- `.gitignore` verified before pushing.
